ember-cli-pretender
===================

Simple wrapper for pretender.js, this project removes the need for the
developer to know which files need to be imported.

=====

```sh
ember install ember-cli-pretender
```

You can then import Pretender in your tests:

```javascript
import Pretender from 'pretender';
```
